Okay so I guess this is my first blog post ever, and my own blog, hosted by GitHub, how cool is that???

# How did I set this up?
I just followed those guides:

- [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
- [creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

I have used my Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS machine (WSL) and installed ruby, jekyll and bundler
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
```

# Test the site locally
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll
Just run 
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Notes
Saving this https://pages.github.com/themes/, could be useful later?



# What's next?
Now I have to read up a bit on Jekyll (e.g. https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), how it works and how to tweak it, find a good design
