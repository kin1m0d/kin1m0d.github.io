# DevOps Resume Project
I want to build a whole pipeline to get some more experience, which also will be good on my CV! This guy basically summarises everything useful [YT link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO-8y_f8YMQ)
Summary:
- It's rarely about the GitHub portfolio but it can make a difference
- Image Build/Config (Docker etc)

- CI/CD (Jenkins)
- Add monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus)
- Add service discovery and a load balancer (Consul, Nginx)
- Everything is in text files
