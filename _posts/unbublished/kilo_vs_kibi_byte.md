# Kilobyte vs Kibibyte



> There are two answers to this.
> Technically, yes, the kibibyte/kilobyte distinction is correct. Technically. Kilo = 1000, kibi = 1024. This was established in 1998 by the International Organization for Standardization, which is the "official" source here.
> However, I have never heard the work "kibibyte" used by a professor, a student, a textbook, or an expert. It is a designated term that very few people actually use ever, because it was invented only recently.
> In ACTUAL PRACTICE, people will laugh at you for using those terms. Seriously, they will. It's like proposing to use the metric system in the US. Nobody is going to do it. It's just a word some organization made up recently.
> The trick is this: it doesn't actually become an issue if you just keep it in context.
> The "1000-byte" kilobyte is used in networking. Wifi, fibers, all of that stuff is in the "official" kilobyte.
> The "1024-byte" kilobyte is used in storage. So "this image is this many kilobytes", or "this virtual cache has a page size of this many kilobytes", or "this flash drive can store this many kilobytes".
> I'd say, if on a test it comes up, use kilobytes. The grad student proofing the test probably won't know what kibibytes are.
