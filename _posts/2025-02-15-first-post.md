Okay so I guess this is my first blog post, ever? And my own blog, hosted by GitHub, how cool is that???

# How did I set this up?
I just followed those guides [quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) and [creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

I have used my Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS machine (WSL) and installed ruby, jekyll and bundler.
``` sh
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
```

# Test the site locally
* <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll>
* Just run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Notes
Saving this <https://pages.github.com/themes/>, could be useful later?

# What's next?
Now I have to read up a bit on Jekyll, figure out how it works and how to tweak it, and find a better design?
